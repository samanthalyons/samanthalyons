- 👋 Hi, I’m @samanthalyons
- 👀 I’m interested in pentesting! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the beginner basics of cybersecurity/offensive security. Very new to this, but learning quickly! :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing atm! But maybe something one day soon!
- 📫 How to reach me s.lyonshale@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have two cats, named Cassiopeia (Pea) and Scout, who are excellent helpers and love to hang out with me when I'm trying to study/practice!
-               (The number of commands in my history that are just keyboard smashes that they've made from walking across/laying on/rolling all over my keyboard is... very large haha)
